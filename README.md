# raiNbow

### Idea

raiNbow is intended to be a headless CMS implemented in .NET. 
The exact shape is still being figured out and no exact goals have been set yet.

This is a project created mainly for fun and participates in the [100commitow](https://100commitow.pl/) challenge.

### Phase

The project is in the PoC development phase. I'm looking for the right approach and the most important concepts to consider.
